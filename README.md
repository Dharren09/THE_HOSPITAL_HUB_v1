# Project Proposal

# Overview
This project aims to develop a hospital management system that will be integrated with other systems and a mobile app. The system will have modules for patients, staff, inventory, billing and payments, appointments, insurance, telehealth, and administrator hub.

# Problem Statement
Hospitals and other healthcare facilities face challenges in managing patient records, staff management, inventory, billing and payments, appointments, and communication with patients. These challenges can lead to errors in diagnosis, treatment, and billing, resulting in dissatisfied patients and financial losses for the hospital.

# Solution
The hospital management system will be a web-based application that will provide an end-to-end solution to manage patient records, staff management, inventory, billing and payments, appointments, and communication with patients. The system will also have a mobile app that will allow patients to access their records and communicate with the hospital.

# Features
1. Patient management: The system will allow hospitals to manage patient records, including personal information, medical history, treatment plans, and prescriptions.
2. Staff management: The system will allow hospitals to manage staff records, including personal information, employment history, qualifications, and work schedules.
3. Inventory management: The system will allow hospitals to manage inventory records, including stock levels, orders, and deliveries.
4. Billing and payments: The system will allow hospitals to manage billing and payments, including generating bills, processing payments, and generating financial reports.
5. Appointments: The system will allow patients to schedule appointments online, and hospitals to manage appointments and schedules.
6. Insurance: The system will allow hospitals to manage insurance records, including verifying insurance, processing claims, and generating reports.
7. Telehealth: The system will allow patients to access telehealth services, including video consultations and remote monitoring.
8. Administrator hub: The system will provide an administrator hub for hospital administrators to manage system settings, permissions, and reports.

# Technologies
The hospital management system will be developed using the following technologies:

1. Python
2. Flask web framework
3. MySQL database
4. SQLAlchemy ORM
5. HTML/CSS/JavaScript
6. React JavaScript library
